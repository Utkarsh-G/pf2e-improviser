# What and Why?

This is a tool to help with improvising encounters with creatures and hazards in PF2e. Use this when you need something quick and dirty, with as few clicks as possible.


If you are doing proper game prep, there are other tools which are better suited to properly create hazards and creatures - notably monster.pf2.tools and the Monster Maker module for Foundry VTT (I'm not affiliated with either).

# How to use for non-devs
You can go to the [demo](https://utkarsh-g.github.io/pf2e-improviser/) and use the form to create a new creature or hazard. 

Nothing is saved, so refreshing the page will clear everything.

Great for one-shots and non-recurring creatures and hazards. Not so great for recurring ones, though you could always screenshot the page for future reference.

# How to use for devs
It's made with create-react-app, so you can run `npm install` and then `npm start` to run it locally.

# Colour Blind Build
There's a branch which adds text to show how severe a stat is. It's there for people with colour blindness, or those who don't find the colour coding to be intuitive.

# Dev status
It's uncertain if I'll continue to work on this. It's at a stage where I can use it for my games, so there's no pressing need for me to improve it. But if there's enough interest, I might add some more features.
