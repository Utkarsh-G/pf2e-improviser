# What and Why?

This is a tool to help with improvising encounters with creatures and hazards in PF2e.

If you are doing proper game prep, there are other tools which are better suited to properly create hazards and creatures. This tool is for those times when you need something quick and dirty, with as few clicks as possible.

# How to use for non-devs
You can go to the [demo](https://utkarsh-g.github.io/pf2e-improviser/) and use the form to create a new creature or hazard. 

Nothing is saved, so refresh the page if you want to clear everything.

Great for one-shots and non-recurring creatures and hazards. Not so great for recurring ones, though you could always screenshot the page for future reference.

# How to use for devs
It's made with create-react-app, so you can run `npm install` and then `npm start` to run it locally.

# Dev status
It's uncertain if I'll continue to work on this. It's at a stage where I can use it for my games, so there's no pressing need for me to improve it. But if there's enough interest, I might add some more features.
